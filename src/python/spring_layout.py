    """Position nodes using Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm.

    The algorithm simulates a force-directed representation of the network
    treating edges as springs holding nodes close, while treating nodes
    as repelling objects, sometimes called an anti-gravity force.
    Simulation continues until the positions are close to an equilibrium.

    There are some hard-coded values: minimal distance between
    nodes (0.01) and "temperature" of 0.1 to ensure nodes don't fly away.
    During the simulation, `k` helps determine the distance between nodes,
    though `scale` and `center` determine the size and place after
    rescaling occurs at the end of the simulation.

    Fixing some nodes doesn't allow them to move in the simulation.
    It also turns off the rescaling feature at the simulation's end.
    In addition, setting `scale` to `None` turns off rescaling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph or list of nodes
        A position will be assigned to every node in G.

    k : float (default=None)
        Optimal distance between nodes.  If None the distance is set to
        1/sqrt(n) where n is the number of nodes.  Increase this value
        to move nodes farther apart.

    pos : dict or None  optional (default=None)
        Initial positions for nodes as a dictionary with node as keys
        and values as a coordinate list or tuple.  If None, then use
        random initial positions.

    fixed : list or None  optional (default=None)
        Nodes to keep fixed at initial position.
        Nodes not in ``G.nodes`` are ignored.
        ValueError raised if `fixed` specified and `pos` not.

    iterations : int  optional (default=50)
        Maximum number of iterations taken

    threshold: float optional (default = 1e-4)
        Threshold for relative error in node position changes.
        The iteration stops if the error is below this threshold.

    weight : string or None   optional (default='weight')
        The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used for
        the edge weight.  Larger means a stronger attractive force.
        If None, then all edge weights are 1.

    scale : number or None (default: 1)
        Scale factor for positions. Not used unless `fixed is None`.
        If scale is None, no rescaling is performed.

    center : array-like or None
        Coordinate pair around which to center the layout.
        Not used unless `fixed is None`.

    dim : int
        Dimension of layout.

    seed : int, RandomState instance or None  optional (default=None)
        Set the random state for deterministic node layouts.
        If int, `seed` is the seed used by the random number generator,
        if numpy.random.RandomState instance, `seed` is the random
        number generator,
        if None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by numpy.random.

    ! added
    method: "FR" or "RS" (default: "FR")

    Returns
    -------
    pos : dict
        A dictionary of positions keyed by node
