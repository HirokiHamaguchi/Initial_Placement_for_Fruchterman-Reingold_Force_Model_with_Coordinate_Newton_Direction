## matrix market

Matrix market is a repository of test matrices for numerical linear algebra.

URL: [MatrixMarket](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/)

Ref: [Matrix Market: a web resource for test matrix collections](https://link-springer-com.utokyo.idm.oclc.org/chapter/10.1007/978-1-5041-2940-4_9)

We use the following matrices:
[jagmesh1](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/data/Harwell-Boeing/jagmesh/jagmesh1.html)
[jagmesh2](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/data/Harwell-Boeing/jagmesh/jagmesh2.html)
[jagmesh3](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/data/Harwell-Boeing/jagmesh/jagmesh3.html)

The matrix jagmesh1 is also used in [Efficient, High-Quality Force-Directed Graph Drawing](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/graph_draw.pdf).

We didn't included these matrices in the repository because we are unsure whether we can redistribute them. You can download them from the above links.

## SuiteSparse Matrix Collection

The SuiteSparse Matrix Collection (formerly known as the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection), is a large and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real applications.

URL: [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection](https://sparse.tamu.edu/)

Matrixes are available via this command line tool: [ssget](https://github.com/drdarshan/ssgetpy)

Since these matrices are under [CC-BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) as mentioned [here](https://sparse.tamu.edu/about), we included them in the repository.
