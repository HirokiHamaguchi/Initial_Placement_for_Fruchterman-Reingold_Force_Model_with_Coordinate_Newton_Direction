## SuiteSparse Matrix Collection

The SuiteSparse Matrix Collection (formerly known as the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection), is a large and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real applications.

URL: [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection](https://sparse.tamu.edu/)

Matrixes are available via this command line tool: [ssget](https://github.com/drdarshan/ssgetpy)

Since these matrices are under [CC-BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) as mentioned [here](https://sparse.tamu.edu/about), we included them in the repository.
